# String Extractor
A tool that allows for the finding of specific strings (using RegEx) in very large files and dumping them as well as their byte location in the file to disk.

It also allows for subsequent RegEx in order to refine the string ouput, though it will always maintain the original byte location.

## Y tho
It is designed to be used to easily extract specific strings, one off or in bulk, from very large files. Files often too large for conventional text editors.

Examples of such files are VM hard disk files.
